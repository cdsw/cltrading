% We would like to express our deep gratitude to Asst.Prof.Dr. Chaiwat Nuthong, our project advisor, for providing us a place to work with all the tools and knowledge as well as giving enthusiastic encouragement and useful assessment for this project. We would also like to thank Dr. Natthapong Jungteerapanich, for his advice in using different techniques and technologies in our project, as well as, showing us some of the related work he found that helps us into shaping the idea for the project. Dr. Isara Anantavrasilp, is sure hard, but because of his persistence in trying to right every bit of wrong in our presentations, we are able further improve our presentation skill and make tremendous effort to improve our project. It is an honor to have him in every of our presentations. Our grateful thanks are also extended to Mr. Kiatkachorn Saripan and every member of the Dynamic Computing Laboratory for their help in providing us valuable suggestions and comments about our presentations and projects. Finally, we wish to thank whom ever read this very copy of the report for spending your valuable time to read the report, we are sure it is full of mistakes and please do not hesitate to make corrections as well as suggestions to our report and kindly return your copy to us at the Dynamic Computing Laboratory.
