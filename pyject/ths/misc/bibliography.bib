 abstract = {This paper considers the problem of selling an asset on the open market. The seller receives a random sequence of price offers, which may arrive either periodically or randomly over time. After each offer is received, the seller must decide whether or not to sell, weighing the possibility of obtaining a better offer against the cost of waiting. A number of authors have established the properties of optimal selling policies when the distribution of offers is known and offers are received periodically. This paper investigates the conditions under which these same properties hold for an unknown offer distribution which is updated as successive offers are received.},

ABSTRACT = {This study conducts a systematic survey on whether the pricing behavior of cryptocurrencies is predictable. Thus, the Efficient Market Hypothesis is rejected and speculation is feasible via trading. We center interest on the Rescaled Range (R/S) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) as well as other relevant methodologies of testing long memory in returns and volatility. It is found that the majority of academic papers provides evidence for inefficiency of Bitcoin and other digital currencies of primary importance. Nevertheless, large steps towards efficiency in cryptocurrencies have been traced during the last years. This can lead to less profitable trading strategies for speculators.},

ABSTRACT = {Flood forecasting is an essential requirement in integrated water resource management. This paper suggests a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for flood forecasting, where the daily discharge and rainfall were used as input data. Moreover, characteristics of the data sets which may influence the model performance were also of interest. As a result, the Da River basin in Vietnam was chosen and two different combinations of input data sets from before 1985 (when the Hoa Binh dam was built) were used for one-day, two-day, and three-day flowrate forecasting ahead at Hoa Binh Station. The predictive ability of the model is quite impressive: The Nash&ndash;Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) reached 99%, 95%, and 87% corresponding to three forecasting cases, respectively. The findings of this study suggest a viable option for flood forecasting on the Da River in Vietnam, where the river basin stretches between many countries and downstream flows (Vietnam) may fluctuate suddenly due to flood discharge from upstream hydroelectric reservoirs.},
